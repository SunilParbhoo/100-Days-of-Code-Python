# 100 Days Of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

I am currently working through ["100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Udemy by Angela Yu and the London App Brewery.
I chose this course (having completed a couple of other Python courses) because of the sheer amount of projects and variety of python modules she exposes you to. I have no doubt that this will help me level-up my skillset.
